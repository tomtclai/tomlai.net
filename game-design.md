## Appendix A: Development Prompts

### Prompt 1 - Setup
```
Let's create the basic game structure. We need to:
1. Add a canvas element to test-game.html
2. Set up the 3x3 grid structure
3. Implement basic click detection
Please implement this first phase.
```

### Prompt 2 - Core Game Logic
```
Now let's implement the core game mechanics by extending the current code:
1. Update click handler to toggle adjacent tiles (up, down, left, right)
2. Add isWinState() function to check if all tiles match (all lit or all dark)
3. Update score when tiles are toggled (increment by 1 per move)
4. Add gameState.moves counter to track number of moves
Please implement these core mechanics while maintaining our dark theme.
```

### Prompt 3 - Polish and User Experience
```
Let's make the game more intuitive and polished:
1. Add clear game instructions at the top:
   - Explain the goal (make all tiles the same color)
   - Show how clicking affects adjacent tiles
   - Use emojis and clear language
2. Add visual feedback:
   - Tile flash animation when clicked
   - Hover effects on interactive elements
   - Clear win state celebration
3. Add quality of life features:
   - "New Game" button
   - Best score tracking with localStorage
   - Move counter
   - Smooth transitions and animations
4. Improve layout and styling:
   - Center-aligned content
   - Consistent spacing
   - Dark theme matching website
Please implement these improvements to make the game more user-friendly.
